<h2>Summary</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify">
webwigo is an online emulator for <a href="http://www.wherigo.com">Wherigo cartridges</a>.
It primary targets authors of such cartridges, allowing them to debug their code at home
before going to the field and finalize the very last details!
</p>

<h2>Browser</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify">
webwigo relies on <a href="http://modernizr.com">Modernizr</a> to check if the required
features (typedarray, xhr2, cors and webworkers) are enabled. However, the application
is built to work in the latest desktop browsers. As such, Internet Explorer 10, Firefox
24 and Chrome 30 are supported.
</p>

<h2>Server</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify">
webwigo runs entirely in the browser. There are no data exchange with the server. The
privacy of your source code is guaranted.
</p> 

<h2>Load</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify">
The emulator currently accepts 3 formats as input: <strong>.lua</strong> (source code,
without medias), <strong>.gwz</strong> (zip archive of source code, with all medias
included) and <strong>.gwc</strong> (compiled version of a .gwz file). The running
cartridge is stopped only if the new one is loaded successfully.
</p>

<div style="padding-left: 64px;">
  <h3>.lua</h3>
  <p style="text-align: justify">
  The provided file should contain a valid Wherigo source code. webwigo extracts the name
  of the cartridge from this file. An error is thrown if this name is not found. If nothing
  happens after clicking the "Run" button, check the "Console" tab to find out the issue
  (syntax error, etc.)
  </p>

  <h3>.gwz</h3>
  <p style="text-align: justify">
  The provided file must be a valid zip archive. It must contain a valid Wherigo source
  code (as specified above) and zero or more medias (images and/or sounds). Depending
  on the number of files, loading may take some time.
  </p>

  <h3>.gwc</h3>
  <p style="text-align: justify">
  The provided file must be a valid compiled Wherigo cartridge. The "Medias" tab is
  disabled and the completion code is never displayed (small protection against cheating).
  </p>
</div>

<h2>Reload</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify">
The current loaded cartridge (.lua, .gwz or .gwc) can be refreshed at any time by clicking
the "Reload" button (the running cartridge is stopped).
</p>

<h2>Run</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify">
Clicking the "Run" button starts (or restarts) the cartridge. Depending on your browser, on
your computer speed and on the cartridge, the initialization may take some time. Since it's
not possible to show a progress bar in that case, make sure to be patient, until the "Splash
Screen" is displayed!
</p>

<h2>Map</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify">
The "Map" tab displays the cartridge starting location (red marker, fixed), the player
location (green marker, draggable), the GPS coordinates, the GPS accuracy (green, orange or
red) and the active zones (green for visible, red for not visible).
